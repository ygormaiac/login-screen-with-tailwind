# [ðŸ’» Login screen made with NextJs and Tailwind CSS](https://codante.io/mini-projetos/mp-tela-login-tailwind)

I had the challenge of creating a login screen using NextJs (since I will still develop new screens, such as sign-up and forgot my password) and to style it, I used the Tailwind CSS framework. The idea is to provide a visually pleasing and responsive experience for users when logging into their systems.

## ðŸ”¨ Requirements
- Create a responsive login screen that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Use the Tailwind CSS framework to style the elements of the login screen.
- I also used Next.js to create new screens responsible for the login process, such as sign-up and forgot my password.
- The login screen must contain the following elements:
- Input field for the username.
- Input field for the password. - "Login" button to log in.
- The main idea was to practice styling with Tailwind CSS.
- It's in progress, in addition to creating new pages, I'm also going to create input and login validations.

## ðŸŽ¨ Suggested design

## To run the project:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
